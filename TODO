paths are suboptimal.
/build/pkgs should be /pkgs
/build/etc should be /dist/etc (maybe not?)
/build/bin should be /dist/bin (maybe not?)
/src should be pkgs/libsage or sagelib

fix package staging (dont use the term "install" for not installing)

fix package uninstall

dependencies must be where packages are, not in "deps"

PYTHON dependency, currently using SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python unconditionally
(do it like singular)

CORE_MODULES should be built with VPATH (?) but with spkg-install

uninstall before fresh install

hook sage -b etc.

BUG: do git hopping, make
../configure: line 5703: syntax error near unexpected token `Cython,CHK_cython=negative'
../configure: line 5703: `   SAGE_CHECK_PYTHON_MODULE(Cython,CHK_cython=negative)'
make: *** [config.status] Error 2
toplevel ./autogen.sh repairs this

remove this file

installation: can be implemented as follows:
- make DESTDIR work (e.g. through sage-dist-install)
- configure sage (the distribution) with a prefix, as usual
- build sage (will install with DESTDIR=@top_builddir@/.local
- @top_builddir@/local symlinks to .local/$prefix
- "make install" now just installs everything


other things:

In other words, it does not work to do:
          $(LN_S) foo /x/bar
Instead, do:
          (cd /x && $(LN_S) foo bar)
