sagedist/etc/dist.sh must be properly configurable

make might be faster when using := where appropriate

make -n |& grep dropped # ?!

<package>-distcheck should run -check

*.Pcython files...

TODO: trap INT TERM EXIT during spkg-install (delete stage-stamp!)

CHECK: order-only dependencies on toolchain links

paths are suboptimal.
/src should be pkgs/sagelib

dependencies must be where packages are, not in "deps"

CORE_MODULES should be built with with sagelib/spkg-install

unstage before fresh stage (when automatically staging?)

recheck: stage unstages before build has completed (good idea?)

decruft dependencies (sagelibspkg vs parts of it)

lapack, atlas. (argh). the lapack package does not install lapack. disabling atlas requires system lapack

complete old Makefile interface.

remove this file

installation: can be implemented as follows (low priority):
- make DESTDIR work (e.g. through sage-dist-install)
- configure sage (the distribution) with a prefix, as usual
- build sage (will install with DESTDIR=@top_builddir@/.local
- @top_builddir@/local symlinks to .local/$prefix
- "make install" just installs everything

conditional silent rules does not work:
m4_ifdef([AM_SILENT_RULES],AM_SILENT_RULES([yes]))
does not set default to "silent",
AM_SILENT_RULES([yes])
does (?!). probably better to not support old autotools at all.
