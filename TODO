paths are suboptimal.
/build/pkgs should be /pkgs
/build/etc should be /dist/etc (maybe not?)
/build/bin should be /dist/bin (maybe not?)
/src should be pkgs/libsage or sagelib

dependencies must be where packages are, not in "deps"

PYTHON dependency, currently using SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python unconditionally
(do it like singular) (done?)

CORE_MODULES should be built with VPATH (?) but with spkg-install

failing doctests, doe to hardcoded paths

uninstall before fresh install

make -n doesnt work very well

decruft dependencies (sagelibspkg vs parts of it)

lapack, atlas. (argh). the lapack package does not install lapack. disabling atlas requires system lapack

hook sage -b etc, complete old Makefile interface.

BUG: do git hopping, make
../configure: line 5703: syntax error near unexpected token `Cython,CHK_cython=negative'
../configure: line 5703: `   SAGE_CHECK_PYTHON_MODULE(Cython,CHK_cython=negative)'
make: *** [config.status] Error 2
toplevel ./autogen.sh repairs this

remove this file

installation: can be implemented as follows:
- make DESTDIR work (e.g. through sage-dist-install)
- configure sage (the distribution) with a prefix, as usual
- build sage (will install with DESTDIR=@top_builddir@/.local
- @top_builddir@/local symlinks to .local/$prefix
- "make install" now just installs everything


other things:

In other words, it does not work to do:
          $(LN_S) foo /x/bar
Instead, do:
          (cd /x && $(LN_S) foo bar)
