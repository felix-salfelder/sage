The build system in src is currenly *not* used by Sage ("the distribution"). it is intended to

- create source tarballs
- build distributable Sage ("the library") packages

caveats:

- unpatched cython does not support writing debug output in the right place.
  debug output will be disabled in this case.

- libgap headers are looked for in <libgap/*.h> not <gap/*.h>, because that's
  where the gap headers are. the libgap-workaround is still contained.
