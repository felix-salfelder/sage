== Description ==
John Cremona's huge database of elliptic curves

See http://www.warwick.ac.uk/~masgaj/ftp/data/ or
http://sage.math.washington.edu/cremona/INDEX.html

This is an optional package, not included by default.

== Update Instructions ==

At the end of either method, copy `SAGE_DATA/cremona/cremona.db` to the src directory of the spkg.

=== Method 1 ===

If the cremona database has already been installed, remove
`SAGE_DATA/cremona/cremona.db`. Run 

{{{ 
sage: sage.databases.cremona.build('cremona','path/to/ecdata.tgz')
}}} 

=== Method 2 ===

Install the current version of the spkg, and copy the new files into a new
folder. Then run 

{{{ 
sage: C = sage.databases.cremona.LargeCremonaDatabase('cremona',False)
sage: C._init_from_ftpdata('path/to/said/folder',0) 
}}}    

This method is much faster, but won't include any potential fixes old entries.

   copied, and so there is no need to use this GNUism.

 * Added an upstream contact, and other data found in 
   a typical SPKG.txt file

=== previous versions ===
 * lost to history
