= Maxima =

== Description ==

Maxima is a system for the manipulation of symbolic and numerical
expressions, including differentiation, integration, Taylor series,
Laplace transforms, ordinary differential equations, systems of linear
equations, polynomials, and sets, lists, vectors, matrices, and
tensors. Maxima yields high precision numeric results by using exact
fractions, arbitrary precision integers, and variable precision
floating point numbers. Maxima can plot functions and data in two and
three dimensions.

== SPKG Maintainers ==

 * TBD

== Upstream Contact ==

 * The Maxima mailing list - see http://maxima.sourceforge.net/maximalist.html

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 * Make sure the patches still apply cleanly.

 * Run the `spkg-src` script after updating to a newer upstream
   release. It removes a large amount of unused documentation and
   disables the associated Makefiles, reducing the size of the SPKG
   greatly.

=============================================================

How to make a new version of the Maxima spkg.

  1. Go to http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4933
     and download the source tar.gz ball.  That's near the bottom
     of that page (i.e., hard to find if you don't scroll past
     all the big red adds).

  2. Extract the tarball to replace the src/ subdirectory of this package.

  3. Create an spkg from this directory, with
        sage -pkg maxima-x.y.z

  4. Test the resulting maxima-??.spkg.

=============================================================

Here's what spkg-dist does:

* Removes the foreign language versions of the info files,
  since they add several MEGS (and they weren't in previous
  versions of Maxima).  This means making empty directories
  and changing the Makefile.in's.

* In the past, before doing step 3 above, one would also type

       ./spkg-dist

  However, this caused problems with calling automake because
  of the changed .in files.
