this is a HACK, but...

- sagedist cannot be part of sagelib,
  because sagelib might be a package "like the others" some day
- sagedist must provide environment in SAGE_ETC/env.d
  because $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage is used for package purposes
- sagedist must not be a package like the others,
  because it cannot install itself
